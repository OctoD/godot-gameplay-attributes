# Install

Clone this repo inside your `addons` directory.

Enable this plugin by going to `project settings/plugins`.

Enjoy! 

## How does it work?

You can check some tutorials/doc/examples [here](./docs/readme.md)

I am making also small "demos" to demonstrate how things work. You can check them out opening this repository using godot 4.x (stable), pressing the play button and choosing one.

`Esc` key will always return you to the main menu.

# Networking Attributes, Effects and Abilities

Did not test too much, but abilities, effects and attributes could be simply replicated using the `MultiplayerSynchronizer` node provided by godot4.x.

The same should apply to `Inventory` and `Equipment`.

# Contribution
