Inventory
=========

An Inventory stores an indefinite amount of `Item`s. 

An `Item` is a `Resource` which could be a health potion, a weapon, a charm or whatever your game needs.

You can put constraints about adding, removing or using items using the `Item` tag system combined with the `Inventory`'s one.

An `Inventory` can also instantiate an `Item` scene, so it can help you to render it in your 2D or 3D world.

With an `Inventory` you can activate, add, remove or search for one or more items.
